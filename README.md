# Welcome to my page
Hello, I'm @subtilf ðŸ‘‹

I started to use github in 2021, before then I never share my personal codes, thus I started to share those codes that was private to the community just for learning purposes.
I'm the kind of person always ready to help other to solve problems and improve something. I love to play guitar, learn new technologies, walk with my dogs and play games :)

Iâ€™m currently learning about k8s, pyspark and related technologies!

# What you will find in my github repos?

The type of repos that you'll find here probably will be:
* Technology evaluation - I always look for new technologies, so every time that I evaluate a new technology, I'll create a repo with its name
  * This type of repo will contain codes using: docker, docker-compose, k8s, shell script, python scripts, ansible, terraform and other related tools
* Data pipeline codes - This type of repo will contain codes related to data pipelines, it can be a code to make just an ingestion or to transform data
  * This type of repo will contain codes using: python (script and OOP), java, scala (come soon), spark (pyspark), spark-streamming and other related technologies
* Architecture vision - This type of repo will contain the architecture and the code related to what I believe to be the best solution/architecture for a theme.
* Terraform modules - Since you can use a module terraform deployed on github, I migrate some of my on tf modules to github to use in others terraforms projects.
* Auxiliar projects - This type of repo will contain codes related to any kind of need related to another projects, it can be a project to generate fake data, libraries and others...
